Takes advantage of a unique set of circumstances- student practice of dinosaur footprint plaster casts. That's a savings of time, and money and possibly danger depending on where these are available in nature [weather conditions, travel, height, rocky conditions, wild animals, etc.].  So this hits my list of reduces time, money, and danger.</p><p>2. Uses 1 or possibly 2 controllers. I can't remember if that could be customized to 1, 2, left, or right. I think there was captioning. Again, can't remember if that was a toggle feature for accessibility. Video might not have shown?</p><p>3. Instructions are direct, clear, and helpful (goldilocks! Not too much, not too little).</p><p>4. Pathways are guided!! When in doubt, objects or actions are glowing--YES. That is, there is a STORY to this experience.</p><p>5. Total experience time is short. (Get in, get out, I like that.)</p><p>P.S. I would LOVE to be "sent" a real plaster cast as a reward, wouldn't be cool? OK, now I'm getting away with myself. Don't do that, it would be frivolous.<br><br>What would Heather add? Narrative plot. I would add some sort of "reason" to a lead-in (intro) and outro to this simulation. Perhaps a construction project that is going to ruin the site or a storm coming?<br><br>Update: I have a post script on the place that made this product. It's not pretty. As a matter of fact, just to keep things REALLY nice here on this blog, I'm not going to link THAT mess to THIS because I have a strong suspicion that the mess that I saw happen close by might not have been the exact same people involved in THIS. Therefore, I'd prefer, if I can help it, to keep them separated. Thus, no link.
