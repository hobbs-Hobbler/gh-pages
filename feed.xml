<p>This will be an ever evolving list and I might create an opposite list (worst educational applications in XR?) someday.</p>
<p>However, because I am the most "bearish" person I know on education in XR, I have to remind myself that there are bright glimmers when education gets it right.  Here are some.</p>
<p>Hint: when you see me like something in XR for education, it probably ticks 2 or 3 of my boxes where XR has been proven in research to be good for learning; places where the XR application reduces</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>time</li>
<li>money</li>
<li>danger</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that in general, I do not encourage media comparison studies (i.e. studies that say that VR is better than PowerPoint). Said another way, research and business should not be engaged in the horse race of saying which media is better for learning overall. </p>

<p>Recently, Leonel Morgado nicely summarized up the argument about XR and effectivness studies here: </p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-08abefa3-7fff-1d1d-888d-52417175b775" style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In the 1970s &amp; early 1980s, the computer arrived in the classroom. There was a great deal of research. Some studies showed that the computer helped learning. Some studies show that the computer hindered learning. The conclusion of this research was that the computer by itself does not make a difference in the learning; it depends on how the computer is used. <br><br>Then comes the 1980s and early 1990s with the edutainment software industry.  What is the impact of this new software? The result: it depends on how you use it. <br><br>In the late 1990s &amp; early 2000s, it was the arrival of serious games that was researched.  What is the impact of serious games on education? <br><br>Same thing is now happening to immersive learning!  <br> </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-08abefa3-7fff-1d1d-888d-52417175b775" style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">We expect the same conclusions, of course. It is pointless to measure the impact of the technology in learning without pairing it with the way it is being used.</span></p>

<p>https://www.churchofengland.org/media-and-news/press-releases/powerful-virtual-reality-service-holy-week-invites-virtual</p>
<p>"During the service, the Canon Missioner for Bristol Cathedral, Jonnie Parkin, invites people to pray in solidarity with the suffering Christ and all who suffer throughout the world.</p>
<p>He said: “The Icon of the Cross in Taizé has for decades been the focus of prayer every Friday by groups of young people drawn from across the world. </p>
<p>“It was poignant to pray around an exact replica of an Icon of the Cross that young people from Russia and Ukraine will have prayed around together in more peaceful times.</p>
<p>“We felt that there was a sense of solidarity, not just with each other, but with people across the world who have prayed around the cross, with Christ in his suffering, and with all those who are suffering and are the victims of violence today.”</p>
<p>The service, with a 360 view, includes spatial audio which allows the virtual congregation to experience the different acoustics of the Chapter House as their outlook changes. </p>
<p>The 17-minute act of worship uses liturgy from <a href="https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/daily-prayer/morning-and-evening#mm008e6">Common Worship: Daily Prayer</a><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;"><span style="color: #606060;">.  </span></span>It can be accessed on any computer or device, with or without special Virtual Reality (VR) equipment."</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Dinosaur Footprint Plaster Cast Laboratory </h2>
<p>Here is the original LI post:</p>
<p>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelmccready_very-proud-of-this-project-this-is-a-sample-activity-6859336457023315969-dgt5</p>
<p>I searched YouTube for the same video and I can't seem to find it. 😕 That means that documentation is not widely available.  (https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmccready/)</p>
<p>But it has several great features all coming together:</p>
<p>1. Takes advantage of a unique set of circumstances- student practice of dinosaur footprint plaster casts. That's a savings of time, and money and possibly danger depending on where these are available in nature [weather conditions, travel, height, rocky conditions, wild animals, etc.].  So this hits my list of reduces time, money, and danger.</p>
<p>2. Uses 1 or possibly 2 controllers. I can't remember if that could be customized to 1, 2, left, or right. I think there was captioning. Again, can't remember if that was a toggle feature for accessibility. Video might not have shown?</p>
<p>3. Instructions are direct, clear, and helpful (goldilocks! Not too much, not too little).</p>
<p>4. Pathways are guided!! When in doubt, objects or actions are glowing--YES. That is, there is a STORY to this experience.</p>
<p>5. Total experience time is short. (Get in, get out, I like that.)</p>
<p>P.S. I would LOVE to be "sent" a real plaster cast as a reward, wouldn't be cool? OK, now I'm getting away with myself. Don't do that, it would be frivolous.<br><br>What would Heather add? Narrative plot. I would add some sort of "reason" to a lead-in (intro) and outro to this simulation. Perhaps a construction project that is going to ruin the site or a storm coming?<br><br>Update: I have a post script on the place that made this product. It's not pretty. As a matter of fact, just to keep things REALLY nice here on this blog, I'm not going to link THAT mess to THIS because I have a strong suspicion that the mess that I saw happen close by might not have been the exact same people involved in THIS. Therefore, I'd prefer, if I can help it, to keep them separated. Thus, no link. Tough.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I find 3 errors:</span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">1. The bolded statements right at the top of the allwork article version allude to "executive summary" or "highlights". But look at that middle one. Remember, when you do something to get your audience’s attention (a screamingly high 97% number!), you better deserve it. In this case, BoA really does not.</span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">2. The general hand-wave effect of statements made throughout are signaling a weak foundation. I worry about this. Who sold what snake oil to which BoA leader for this entire project to proceed.</span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">3. A lack of needs analysis might have happened, but claiming that a “lack of evidence”<em> is</em> evidence for something is shaky ground. Nonetheless, BoA leaves a few hints. ("</span>We are constantly seeking ways to implement advanced technologies that offer better solutions for our teammates and our clients.")<br></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Bonus points: the headset are rolling out at 4,300 locations but called “VR”---- which is funny because you could roll out VR at an infinite number of locations with zero headsets (cough, webXR, cough)...but I guess that memo didn’t make it around.</span></span></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;">That 97% tho...</h2>
<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">1. You got my attention, bold bullet</span></span></h1>

I worry that they don't work for BoA anymore (giggle). But statistically, they had 400 employees in their pilot test group so that means 12 employees didn't "feel more comfortable". Any bets on vertigo? I'm going with that.</span></span></span></div>

<div style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: helvetica; font-size: small; color: var(--text-primary-color);">But hey, let's pass some kudos to the training department at BoA because 97% of the employees DID feel "more comfortable" performing their tasks after going through the training. So yay! You ARE making an impact. </span></div>

Duh. 🙄</span></span></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div> </div>
<div><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: helvetica; font-size: small; color: var(--text-primary-color);">Back to being cynical though, ithrowing around a number like 97% stirs the pot of folks' angst with math and understanding. I bet that if I took a 'flash survey' of readers of this article, I'd get some people who would say "learners that used VR got a 97% on their BoA test". Yeah, </span><u style="background-color: transparent; font-family: helvetica; font-size: small; color: var(--text-primary-color);">it doesn't say that at all.</u></div>

<div style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><u><br></u>See how the line "Lies, damn lies, and statistics" is descriptive here.  The lesson is don't waive a 97% in front of a person with any math sense. They'll go ballistic telling you that you are wrong. </span></span></span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> </span></span></p>

Hand Wave Statements</strong> </span></span></span></h1>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I must credit the "hand wave" phrase to my former colleague Gideon Weinstein when we used to do Master's Degree Oral Defense Examinations together. He'd say, "We don't allow 'hand wave' explanations in math." This means that you can't get to a formula, for example, and say "we just solve it from here". You MUST show your work and that includes showing<i> every step</i> of the solution. No hand waving as if it is so obvious that we don't need to explain it.</span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">So this article does an uncomfortable amount of hand waving. It's tucked in with weak evidence statements which I also indicate.</span></span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I find 3 errors:</span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">1. The bolded statements right at the top of the allwork article version allude to "executive summary" or "highlights". But look at that middle one. Remember, when you do something to get your audience’s attention (a screamingly high 97% number!), you better deserve it. In this case, BoA really does not.</span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">2. The general hand-wave effect of statements made throughout are signaling a weak foundation. I worry about this. Who sold what snake oil to which BoA leader for this entire project to proceed.</span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">3. A lack of needs analysis might have happened, but claiming that a “lack of evidence”<em> is</em> evidence for something is shaky ground. Nonetheless, BoA leaves a few hints. ("</span>We are constantly seeking ways to implement advanced technologies that offer better solutions for our teammates and our clients.")<br></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Bonus points: the headset are rolling out at 4,300 locations but called “VR”---- which is funny because you could roll out VR at an infinite number of locations with zero headsets (cough, webXR, cough)...but I guess that memo didn’t make it around.</span></span></span></p>

I worry that they don't work for BoA anymore (giggle). But statistically, they had 400 employees in their pilot test group so that means 12 employees didn't "feel more comfortable".

He'd say, "We don't allow 'hand wave' explanations in math." This means that you can't get to a formula, for example, and say "we just solve it from here". You MUST show your work and that includes showing<i> every step</i> of the solution. No hand waving as if it is so obvious that we don't need to explain it.</span></span></span></p>
